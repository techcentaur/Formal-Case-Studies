#### Challenges for Electronic Voting in India

- **Cost** : We need our design to be a product that can be manufactured easily i.e. it shouldn't be costly as over a million EVMs are used in a major voting event.

- **Power** : Over 300 million of Indians live with no access to proper electricity; EVMs should be able to operate entirely from battery power, not merely using battery as a backup.

- **Natural Hazards** : We need its hardware tough enough to bear the different climate conditions of India, from extremes of temperature, to dust and pollution. EVM should operate under all possible conditions.

- **Illiteracy** : Machine is designed to use instructions without written scripts, since a person need not be literate in order to vote, right to vote is fundamental and must always be respected in every situation.

- **Unfamiliarity with Technology** : EVMs should be simple enough that it could be used by any illiterate person with extremely low level of technological knowledge to any expert in technology.

- **Booth-capturing** - Incase, a booth is captured by a anonymous force, the machine shall preserve the counted number of votes if possible, if not, it shall only count vote within certain intervals of time, for e.g. 4 votes in a minute, which will ensure that votes won't get tampered too much until help arrives.
