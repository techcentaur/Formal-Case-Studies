# Public Distribution System Design

**AIM** : A functional design to automate the public distribution system in India with more transparency, more conversion rate and less corruption

### What is Public Distribution System?

Indian food security system, established by the Government of India under Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution is to distribute subsidized food and non-food items to India's poor. 

### Responsibilities

The central and state governments share the responsibility of regulating the PDS.
- Central government is responsible for procurement, storage, transportation, and bulk allocation of food grains.
- State governments hold the responsibility for distributing the same to the consumers through the established network of Fair Price Shops (FPSs). 
- State governments are also responsible for operational responsibilities including allocation and identification of families below poverty line, issue of ration cards, supervision and monitoring the functioning of FPSs.

### Fallouts of PDS

PDS has not been at its best, it consists of a large share of defects. Let's analyse some of them
- **Quality of Food** : Consumers have reported an inferior quality food.
- **Corruption of Dealer**
	- Dealers replace quality goods supplies from FCI with inferior and old inventory stock.
- **Corruption of Shop owners**
	- Creates fake card numbers to recieve stock by fake names to sell legally in open market.
	- Holding and then selling the stock in black markets.
- **Identification of Poor class** : More than 30% poor class have no awareness about this scheme, and were unable to get identified legally as BPL(below poverty line).
- **Irregular Categorisation of Poverty line distinction** : This non ambiguity gives massive scope for corruption and fallouts in PDS systems.

### A word about NFSA(National Food Security Act, 2013)

- [National Food Security Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Food_Security_Act,_2013), 2013 (also **Right to Food** Act) is an Act of the Parliament of India which aims to provide subsidized food grains to approximately two thirds of India's 1.2 billion people.
- It includes the [**Midday Meal Scheme**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midday_Meal_Scheme), [**Integrated Child Development Services**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Child_Development_Services) scheme and the [**Public Distribution System**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Distribution_System).
