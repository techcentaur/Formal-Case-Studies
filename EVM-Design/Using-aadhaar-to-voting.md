- Currently, any voter V obtains his Voter-ID VID/UID from election office used for authentication in polling office before the vote.

- The unique identity number of aadhaar card can be used as a key to know whether a person has voted or he hasn't. We can assign every person a particular location and then state wise create a database with the aadhaar number stored, if the person has voted, for every new person, we could calculate if the person has already voted or not.

- After this, marking ink in the index finger will not be necessary as the identification, for if, the person has already voted or not.

- The problem of the duplicate vote can also be solved with this solution.

- Our database will contain the aadhaar number of the people that had voted, so it will also be an accurate measure of people voted and cannot be tampered as contains an unintelligible information.
