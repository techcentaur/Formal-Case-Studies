## Cryptographic system

Cryptography is an essential part of providing data confidentiality, integrity, and authentication in the security and thus used with similar aim.

When single key is used for both encryption and decryption, the symmetric cryptosystem requires transferring a secret key to both communication parties before secure communication can begin. The shared secret key between the communication parties is a problem as a secure confidential channel is required. So, this problem of shared key can be dealt with using asymmetric cryptosystem i.e. using different keys for encryption and decryption.
