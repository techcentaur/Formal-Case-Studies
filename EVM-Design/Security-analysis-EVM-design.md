- EVM uses a simple embedded system design and thus would consist of around thousand lines of code, which can run directly on hardware.

- Every EVM have a unique ID to identify about the polling booth it was used in.

- EVM will be connected to a remote server with a network connection via any communication mechanism, to backup the vote storage.

- Votes will be stored in encrypted form by using a cryptosystem with more than one public keys for encryption and a private key for decryption.

## Analysis of security

- Can withstand any security attacks on data in the storage.

- Backup of votes when EVM is tempered.

-  Integrity - votes cannot be changed

- Freedom - no one can see vote.

- Mixing before counting

- counting secured

- system secureness due to private key.
